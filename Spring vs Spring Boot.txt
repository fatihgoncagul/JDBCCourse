So how will we implement this dependency injection concept using Spring

Before actual coding we need to understand this:

Spring Boot is built on top of Spring Framework

Spring at first needed too many configuritaions for even a simple project
So Spring Boot (Opinionated Framework) come up to ease the process.
Spring Boot it will give us the project to run, we dont need too many configurations

Using spring boot means we are also using spring framework since s boot is built on top of spring framework
